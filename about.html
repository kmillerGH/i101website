I am also working to supplement those majors with a co-major in International Business, a minor in Spanish, and also a minor in Economics. I am involved on campus with the IU Sailing Club and YoungLife.  <br/> My favorite sport is hockey as it was the only sport I played in high school. My favorite sports teams include the Chicago Blackhawks, Colts and Pacers, and Real Madrid. I am big fan of Cristiano Ronaldo and love to watch him play. My favorite TV shows include Supernatural, White Collar, Person of Interest, Burn Notice, and many others.
