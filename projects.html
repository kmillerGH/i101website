	<p>	Project Title: I101 Final Group Project <br />
    	Group Members: I101 Team 6 <br />
        Project Description: In this project my group and I are going to design and plan out a problem using technology as our forum for the solution. What my group only decided upon was designing an all in one website where people could come to learn about world hunger. This website would have more information than they could possibly want to know, being constantly updated with statistics and real world information daily to make sure people stay informed. </p>
    <p> Project Title: X202 Take Home Practical <br />
    	Group Members: None <br />
        Project Description: In this project I had to design a user form via excel for a home construction company that was looking to streamline its building options for its users. I  was tasked with designing a form that dynamically updated to different users choices, gave them prices and pacakages options, and ultimately helped them choose thier dream home. A link to the excel document can be found below. </p>

    <p> Project Title: A106 Final Project <br />
    	Group Membters: Andrew Jones <br />
        Project Description: A106 is a computer science course that teaches how to program in Python. For this project I had to create a game only in Python called Ludo. The game rules are quite complex but basically its like a simplified game of Sorry. I am quite proud of this work as it took me a long time to figure it out and required all my knowledge of Python to complete. I receive a perfect score. A link for the project can be found below </p>
